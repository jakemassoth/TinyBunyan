# Logs and saved filters feature

Requirements:

- As a user, I want to be able to see a tail logs come in live from my project
- As a user, I want to be able to filter the logs based on some criteria:
  - Grep inside the log content
  - I want to save this filter and start storing all the logs under this criteria
  - I want to set a timeframe where this filter stops saving after
  - I want to set a number of logs to save before the filter stops saving

Also considering that I might want to use the same filtering mechanism for the metrics feature
